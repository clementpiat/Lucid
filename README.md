## Overview

The "Front" is in `resources/`.

The Logic that contains almost everything is in `app/index.js`.

See `https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/command-line-interface/` on how to use Fitbit SDK. We are using Fitbit SDK 4.2.

## Data

You can find examples of the data we record in `data`. `hrs.json` contains a list of hear rate measures, `as.json` contains a list of accelerations.
